Narendra Damodardas <a href=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/indias-divider-in-chief-pm-modi-features-on-time-magazine-cover-5720637/>Modi on it&rsquo;s cover page</a></p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/necOF1d.jpg><figcaption><div class=figcaption>India's Divider in Chief</div></figcaption></figure><p>The article opens with the sentence:</p><blockquote><div class=quote>Of the great democracies to fall to populism, India was the first.</div><cite>TIME</cite></blockquote><p>Under Prime Minister Modi, the story read,</p><blockquote><div class=quote>Nation’s most basic norms, such as the character of the Indian state, its
founding fathers, the place of minorities and its institutions, from
universities to corporate houses to the media, were shown to be severely
distrusted.</div><cite>TIME</cite></blockquote><p>Furthering the argument, it says:</p><blockquote><div class=quote>“…Under Modi, minorities of every stripe – from liberals and lower castes to
Muslims and Christians – have come under assault”</div><cite>TIME</cite></blockquote><p>It talked about the promise of the economic reform of the messiah which has
failed to materialize and how &ldquo;he [the BJP] is lucky to be blessed with so weak
an opposition–a ragtag coalition of parties, led by the Congress, with no agenda
other than to defeat him</p><p>But, we aren&rsquo;t here to debate this. Let&rsquo;s look at the before and aftermath of
the incident.</p><p><strong>2012</strong></p><figure><img src=https://img.timeinc.net/time/images/covers/asia/2012/20120716_600.jpg><figcaption><div class=figcaption>Manmohan Singh featured on one of the 2012 editions of the same magazine</div></figcaption></figure><p>In 2012, Manmohan Singh appeared on the cover of the same magazine as &ldquo;The
Underachiever&rdquo;, even which might have been an understatement at the time.</p><p>Many of BJP supporters including but not limited to their leader
<a href=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-attacks-manmohan-after-time-magazine-report/article3616536.ece#!>Ravi Shankar Prasad, without a shred of doubt on the authenticity of the
article, straight away demanded his resignation</a> on the grounds
that the image of India has been spoiled.</p><figure><img src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/8f/69/3d8f69a98f3fdeef9359d8a1ef7b49ba.jpg><figcaption><div class=figcaption>Narendra Modi appears for the first time on the cover page of TIME, highlighted positively</div></figcaption></figure><p>A subsequent edition of TIME in 2012 again showed interest in Indian economy
featuring Modi on cover page entitled &ldquo;Modi means business&rdquo; - enforcing the
dream BJP instilled in Indians of the economic reform it promised.</p><p><strong>2015</strong></p><figure><img src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/india-final.jpg?quality=85&w=840"><figcaption><div class=figcaption>Modi, now Prime Minister, appeared once again on the cover page of TIME.</div></figcaption></figure><p>And again in 2015, Modi was featured, this time as the Prime Minister. The tag
line said &ldquo;Why Modi Matters&rdquo; depicting Modi government positively.</p><p>Apart from this, he was also rewarded a place in the list of &ldquo;The 100 Most
Influential People&rdquo; by (yes, you guessed it right) TIME in 2014, 2015 and 2017
editions.</p><p>Up until now, all in favour, all good - Lo and behold, TIME magazine is the best
magazine in the world.</p><p><strong>2019</strong></p><p>The trend line of TIME on the opinion on Narendra Modi is very similar to the
change of opinion of people, slowly declining until 2017 and a much steeper fall
after that. The cover page of 2019 is a simple depiction of that, but now the
complaints begin.</p><h3 id=controversy-behind-pakistani-writer>Controversy behind Pakistani Writer</h3><p>The author of article, Mr. Aatish Taseer is a Pakistani Journalist. Following the
release of the magazine, his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aatish_Taseer&type=revision&diff=896408874&oldid=896403743">wikipedia page was severly vandalized</a> - stating
that he writes against Brahmins, is a member of Lashkar-E-Tayabba, a pakistani
militant group and that he is also working as a PR manager for Congress.</p><p><figure><img src=/images/freedom-of-speech/ateesh-wiki.png><figcaption><div class=figcaption>Wikipedia page of Aatish vandalized</div></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/freedom-of-speech/ateesh-wiki2.png></figure></p><p>This false information was then tweeted numerous times as widespread propaganda
by some trolls on the internet. Other means to defame him were also adopted.</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9d2Z78v.jpg><figcaption><div class=figcaption>One of many fake TIME cover created by trolls for defaming Aatish</div></figcaption></figure><p>One thing worth noting here is that yes, the author actually is half-pakistani
(born to an Indian mother, Mrs. Tavleen Singh and a Pakistani father, Mr. Salmaan
Taseer). In fact, Mr. Salmaan was one of the most liberal politicians of Pakistan,
leading to his <a href=https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/04/pakistans-dangerous-blasphemy-laws-claim-the-governor-of-punjab/>assassination in 2011 because of his strong opinions on Blasphemy
Laws in Pakistan</a> and his mother, <a href=https://twitter.com/tavleen_singh/status/1126665638582177792>Mrs. Tavleen appeers to be a Modi supporter</a>.</p><p>This was the journey of the TIME magazine - from being used as a source for
asking resignation of a Prime Minster in 2012 to being stamped as an
anti-nationalist, anti-hindu, pro-Pakistani and pro-Congress magazine - which
cannot be trusted at all.</p><h2 id=the-rise-of-authoritarianism>The Rise of authoritarianism</h2><p>For the past few years, there has been a shift in governance model and their
policy and stance on failures - furthering more and more towards
authoritarianism. Anyone who dare questions them or speaks against them is
drafted &lsquo;anti-national&rsquo; and crazy as it might sound - &lsquo;anti-hindu&rsquo;. First comes
hate speech, death threats and trolling for propaganda. Even then, if someone
doesn&rsquo;t stop, then, if they are lucky, <a href=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sedition-case-registered-against-arundhati-roy-geelani-440611>they are charged with sedition</a><sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>

mainstream media portraying them as criminals or associating them with terrorist
organizations, which brings me to my second point&mldr;</p><h2 id=freedom-of-the-press>Freedom of The Press</h2><p>It isn&rsquo;t just the voice of the student leaders and activists which is silenced,
but even the mainstream media journalists are being denied their right to free

outside her house</a> because she was an outspoken critic of
right-wing-&lsquo;hindutva&rsquo;-politics and was present at the forefront of many
protests, including the protest against the smearing of Kannada writer Yogesh
Master’s face with black ink.</p><p>When Punya Prasun Bajpayi, in his show <em>Masterstroke</em> uncovered some false
claims made by Prime Minister regarding a rural lady by interviewing her, TV
screens <a href=https://scroll.in/article/889026/resignations-of-two-journalists-at-abp-news-cause-disquiet-in-newsrooms-and-far-beyond>were blackened out</a> for the consequent episodes for his show in many
parts of the nation. This political pressure on ABP news further lead to
<a href=https://scroll.in/article/889026/resignations-of-two-journalists-at-abp-news-cause-disquiet-in-newsrooms-and-far-beyond>resignation of ABP&rsquo;s network managing editor, Milind Khandekar</a>, closely
followed by Bajpayi&rsquo;s own. After this round of resignations, another journalist
at the network <a href=https://www.newslaundry.com/shorts/abp-news-abhisar-sharma-resigns>Abhisar Sharma went for leave</a> and <a href=https://www.newslaundry.com/shorts/abp-news-abhisar-sharma-resigns>finally resigned a few
days later</a>.</p><p>This is an organized attack on media, disrupting any dialogue or questions in
the matter of starvation deaths, unemployment, education affairs, farmer
suicides, clean air and water.</p><p>The <a href=https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/modi-interviews-packed-with-lines-rg-could-never-get-away-with-2037244>scripted interviews</a> which our Prime Minister gives, all the
