reporter. Amongst coala&rsquo;s fundamental <code>code checkers</code> known as <code>Bears</code>, there is
a <code>VultureBear</code> which runs vulture over the input batch of files and prepares a
patch for the respective files. The project proposal focuses on improving the
VultureBear and making vulture available as a library rather than as command
line tool.</p><p>Full project description can be found here: <a href=https://rj722.tech/gsoc_project>GSoC Project I am working on this
summer</a></p><h2 id=milestones>Milestones</h2><p>The milestones are yet to be reviewed by my mentor
(<a href=https://github.com/jendrikseipp>@jendrikseipp</a>).</p><h3 id=pre---community-bonding-period--up-till--may-4>Pre - Community Bonding Period ( Up Till May 4)</h3><ul><li>Initial investigation and discussion on what features to be added to API, and
start implementing them on the go.</li><li>Continue discussion with the community on ast and enhanced pyflakes ast - What
are the underlying differences, and what can be possible implementations for
source range acquisition.</li><li>Diagnose possible cases which would render the code unreachable.</li><li>Inculcate a habit of downloading the trending project of the day, running
vulture on it, analyzing the results and adding anything suitable to whitelist
file. This would help us in maintaining a rich whitelist file.</li><li>Prioritize all the goals and targets</li></ul><h3 id=community-bonding-may-5---30>Community Bonding (May 5 - 30)</h3><ul><li>Finalize what should be implemented for source range acquisition on the basis
of discussions during pre - community bonding period.</li></ul><h3 id=week-1--2-may-31---june-13>Week 1 & 2 (May 31 - June 13)</h3><ul><li>Implement API - At this point, we would have a fully functioning API, and we
would be ready to incorporate these changes into the VultureBear.</li><li>Refactor VultureBear to incorporate API - This would be relatively easy as the
API would have had until now respected it’s usage in the VultureBear.</li></ul><h3 id=week-3-june-14---20>Week 3 (June 14 - 20)</h3><ul><li>Realize VultureBear completely - At this point, it should be able to execute
vulture, parse output, produce the patch file for removing the dead code what so
ever found. Review the tests written so far and add relevant test cases.</li><li>Document Bear</li><li>API documentation including, but not limited to possible use cases, example
code snippets</li><li>See that code is completely documented in place</li><li>Buffer time to finish pending work.</li></ul><h3 id=week-4-june-20---26>Week 4 (June 20 - 26)</h3><ul><li>Develop an analysis report on what all constructs can we detect with complete
surety, partial surety and the ones we cannot detect for the sake of
implementing a confidence value with results. (A crude version is here in this
thread).</li><li>Discuss on the levels of certainty we would need to have (perhaps four for
highly accurate (100%), accurate (>80%), medium (70 - 80%) and can’t say)</li></ul><h3 id=week-5-june-27---july-4>Week 5 (June 27 - July 4)</h3><ul><li>Create whitelist files for popular Python frameworks like Django</li><li>Configure vulture in order to ensure that whitelist is taken into account by
default.</li><li>Updating docs and writing tests.</li></ul><h3 id=week-6-july-4---15>Week 6 (July 4 - 15)</h3><ul><li>Adapt to the strategy worked during community bonding period for obtaining
source range.</li></ul><h3 id=week-7--8-july-15---29>Week 7 & 8 (July 15 - 29)</h3><ul><li>Diagnose the instances of unreachable code, our concern here would be to
identify all such cases which would render the code unreachable, like the if
False; if True: else; code after return statements, etc. - Adding this to the
dead code classes, under a new category: get_unreachable</li></ul><h3 id=week-9-august-1---7>Week 9 (August 1 - 7)</h3><ul><li>Integrate these results with the VultureBear, which would primarily consist
of:</li><li>Transmitting source range, and unreachable code instances through API</li><li>Yielding the results of Bear in the new format.</li></ul><h3 id=week-11-august-8---17>Week 11 (August 8 - 17)</h3><ul><li>Adding the suitable documentation for the new changes incorporated in the API,
Bear and vulture itself.</li><li>Code Review</li><li>Taking feedback and making any improvements proposed.</li></ul><h3 id=week-12-august-17---24>Week 12 (August 17 - 24)</h3><ul><li>Buffer week to complete any pending work, evaluate and review tasks completed,
review documentation and test cases.</li></ul><div class=post-ender><div class=tag-list>TAGGED AS:<div class=tag><a href=https://rj722.com/blog/tags/GSoC>GSOC</a></div></div><div class=share><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=GSoC%20Project%20Timeline&url=https%3a%2f%2frj722.com%2fblog%2fproject-timeline%2f&via=antisemantic"><div class=share__image><img src=https://rj722.com/images/share-on-twitter.svg></div><div class=share__text>Share on Twitter</div></a></div><div class=break-line></div></div><div class=about><div class=t2>JOIN ME</div><p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Rahul.
