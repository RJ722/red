It takes me
new places, and teaches me new things, and I quite like it. This time, rather
than focussing on Vulture specifically, I wanted to spend more time on automated
code analysis in general.</p><p>I also wanted to have a nice ice-breaker to loosen up the awkwardness which is
generally present in technical conferences. And since we were in Italy, why not
Football? I started off with some old shots of Baggio <em>head faking</em>:</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E5bIFYt.gif><figcaption><div class=figcaption><p>A head fake is when you kick the ball in the direction opposite to what your body pretended to kick</p></div></figcaption></figure><p>The phrase &ldquo;head fake&rdquo; was first used by <a href=lastlec>Randy Pausch</a> to denote
<em>hidden</em> indirect learnings from other activities, e.g. when children play
football, they don&rsquo;t just learn how to kick a ball, they also learn skills like
leadership, communication, comradery, etc.</p><p>Limited by how little I actually know about football, I promptly segued back to
code analysis.</p><p>As they say, if you want someone to do something, convince them <em>why</em>. There&rsquo;s a
better option though: Tell them the cost of not doing it. That&rsquo;s how we start.</p><p>37 seconds into descent in June 1996, the Ariane5 rocket flipped by 90 degrees
and tore itself apart. Reason, it turned out, was a floating point error in the
IMU. Trying to stuff a 64-bit value into a 16-bit variable. The thing which made
it even more unfortunate was that this value wasn&rsquo;t even being utilized in the
guidance system. That&rsquo;s right: writing invalid data to an unused variable ended
up obliterating a $500mn rocket.</p><p>Detecting these kinds of mistakes is what code analysis tools excel at. To tell
you whether or not your code follows best practices, or if the function you&rsquo;re
using is prone to certain attack vectors or whether you comply with the style
guide or not, or if you&rsquo;re doing strange things like leaving dead code or unused
imports behind. These tools together voice the collective wisdom of the
community.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The voice of the people has been likened to the voice of God.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><cite>Niccolo Machiavelli</cite></p><p>During the later half, I gave a brief demo of Vulture &ndash; how to run it, tweak
all its knobs and joints to optimize it on your codebase, etc.</p><p>The last part was the most exciting one, where I drew out <em>how</em> Vulture worked
under the hood with Abstract Syntax Trees.</p><figure><img src=https://rj722.github.io/red/images/pycon_italy/ast.png><figcaption><div class=figcaption><p>How Vulture parses an AST</p></div></figcaption></figure><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This talk was a head fake of sort: &ldquo;<em>Let&rsquo;s learn about Vulture</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>Let&rsquo;s take
charge of our code quality!</em>&rdquo;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: how Vulture works is irrelevant for most, if not all of its
users. But knowing that there&rsquo;s a way you can just parse the AST yourself and
write a method to do <em>that</em> is incredibly powerful.</p><p>P.S. The video isn&rsquo;t out yet. I&rsquo;ll make sure to add a link here as soon as it&rsquo;s out.</p><div class=post-ender><div class=tag-list>TAGGED AS:<div class=tag><a href=https://rj722.github.io/red/blog/tags/python>PYTHON</a></div><div class=tag><a href=https://rj722.github.io/red/blog/tags/conference>CONFERENCE</a></div><div class=tag><a href=https://rj722.github.io/red/blog/tags/talk>TALK</a></div></div><div class=share><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=My%20talk%20at%20PyCon%20Italy&url=https%3a%2f%2frj722.github.io%2fred%2fblog%2fpycon-italy%2f&via=antisemantic"><div class=share__image><img src=https://rj722.github.io/red/images/share-on-twitter.svg></div><div class=share__text>Share on Twitter</div></a></div><div class=break-line></div></div><div class=about><div class=t2>JOIN ME</div><p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Rahul.
