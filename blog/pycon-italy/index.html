It takes me
new places, and teaches me new things, and I quite like it. This time, it was
even more special &ndash; it was in Italy. And rather than focussing on Vulture
specifically, I wanted to spend more time on automated code analysis in
general.</p><p>I also wanted to have a nice ice-breaker to loosen up the awkwardness which is
generally present in technical conferences. And since we were in Italy, why not
Football?</p><p>I started off with some old shots of Baggio <em>head faking</em>:</p><figure><img src=https://i.imgur.com/E5bIFYt.gif><figcaption><div class=figcaption><p>A head fake is when you kick the ball in the direction opposite to what your body pretended to kick</p></div></figcaption></figure><p>The phrase &ldquo;head fake&rdquo; was first used by <a href=lastlec>Randy Pausch</a> to denote
<em>hidden</em> indirect learnings from other activities, e.g. when children play
football, they don&rsquo;t just learn how to kick a ball, they also learn skills like
leadership, communication, comradery, etc.</p><p>Limited by how little I actually know about football, I promptly segued back to
code analysis.</p><p>As they say, if you want someone to do something, convince them <em>why</em>. There&rsquo;s a
better option though: Tell them the cost of not doing it. That&rsquo;s how we start.</p><p>37 seconds into descent in June 1996, the Ariane5 rocket flipped by 90 degrees
and tore itself apart. Reason, it turned out, was a floating point error in the
IMU: trying to stuff a 64-bit value into a 16-bit variable. The thing which made
it even more unfortunate was that this value wasn&rsquo;t even being utilized in the
guidance system. That&rsquo;s right: writing invalid data to an unused variable ended
up obliterating a $500mn rocket.</p><p>Detecting these kinds of mistakes is what code analysis tools excel at. To tell
you whether or not your code follows best practices, or if the function you&rsquo;re
using is prone to attack vectors or whether you comply with the style guide or
not, or if you&rsquo;re doing strange things like leaving dead code or unused imports
behind. These tools, together, give voice to the collective wisdom of the
community.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The voice of the people has been likened to the voice of God.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><cite>Niccolo Machiavelli</cite></p><p>During the later half, I gave a brief demo of Vulture &ndash; how to run it, tweak
all its knobs and joints to optimize it for your codebase, etc.</p><p>The last part, however, was the most exciting: I drew out <em>how</em> Vulture worked
under the hood with Abstract Syntax Trees.</p><figure><img src=https://rj722.com/images/pycon_italy/ast.png><figcaption><div class=figcaption><p>How Vulture parses an AST</p></div></figcaption></figure><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This talk was a head fake of sort: &ldquo;<em>Let&rsquo;s learn about Vulture</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<em>Let&rsquo;s take
charge of our code!</em>&rdquo;</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: how Vulture works is irrelevant for most, if not all, of its
users. But, knowing that there&rsquo;s a way you can just pluck the AST and mess with it.
It&rsquo;s incredibly powerful.</p><p><del>P.S. The video isn&rsquo;t out yet.
