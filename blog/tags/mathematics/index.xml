This theory would soon unveil a series of confusing paradoxes, leading to a crisis in the Mathematics community regarding the stability of the foundational principles of the math of that time.
Central to these paradoxes was the Russell&amp;rsquo;s paradox (or more generally, as we&amp;rsquo;d talk about later, the Epimenides Paradox).</description></item></channel></rss>
