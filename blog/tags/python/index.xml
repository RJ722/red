It takes me new places, and teaches me new things, and I quite like it. This time, it was even more special &amp;ndash; it was in Italy. And rather than focussing on Vulture specifically, I wanted to spend more time on automated code analysis in general.
I also wanted to have a nice ice-breaker to loosen up the awkwardness which is generally present in technical conferences.</description></item></channel></rss>
