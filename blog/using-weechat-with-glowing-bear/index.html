Bear</a>, which has been a really nice improvement, allowing me to access
Weechat (hosted on a server) through my browser. Here&rsquo;s how I set it up.</p><p>But, before we begin - the curious folks might ask, &ldquo;What had you been using
all this time?&rdquo;</p><p>Previously, I could directly ssh<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> into my server, and attach to a
<a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/><code>screen</code></a> session which ran weechat, using the command:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>mosh USERNAME@SERVER_IP -- screen -D -RR weechat
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is pretty neat, why would you want to change it?</p><p>&ldquo;Latency&rdquo; - It was not pleasant, so much so, that I started running two
instances of weechat - one locally for chatting, and the one on the server for
listening to messages when AFK. It was getting pretty unmanageable, so I decided
to look for alternatives. Luckily, one of my friends, <a href=https://blog.lazkani.io/about_me/>Armageddon</a>,
pointed me towards <a href=https://www.glowing-bear.org/#!/>Glowing Bear</a> - which provides a nice web frontend to
weechat.</p><h2 id=setting-up-glowing-bear>Setting Up Glowing Bear</h2><p>Glowing Bear has pretty decent documentation available at
<a href=https://www.glowing-bear.org/#!/>https://www.glowing-bear.org/#!/</a>.</p><p>The basic architecture is somewhat similar to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern>pub-sub architecure</a> - weechat &lsquo;relays&rsquo; (publishes) all messages at a particular port on
a machine where glowing bear can then &rsquo;listen&rsquo; for the messages (subscribe).</p><p>Can other people listen to my messages?</p><p>If you&rsquo;re running glowing bear with a local instance of weechat, you shouldn&rsquo;t
worry too much. However, if connecting to a remote instance, you must encrypt
all communications between your browser and WeeChat.</p><p>Since <a href=https://www.glowing-bear.org/#!/>Glowing Bear</a> uses TLS for encryption, it means that we need to put
up a signed certificate. They recommend using <a href=https://letsencrypt.org/>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> for
getting a certificate, which is really easy. Just install <a href=https://certbot.eff.org/>certbot</a> and
run:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>certbot certonly --standalone -d DOMAIN_NAME
</code></pre><p>Once the certificates are generated, the only thing was to make them
visible to weechat:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>$ mkdir -p ~username/.weechat/ssl
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>$ cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/DOMAIN_NAME/<span class=o>{</span>fullchain,privkey<span class=o>}</span>.pem &gt; ~username/.weechat/ssl/relay.pem
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>$ chown -R username:username ~username/.weechat/ssl/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, the only issue with me was that I did not have superuser access to the box
I was running weechat into, and therefore could not access cert files. But,
After talking to my wonderful host at <a href=https://wwww.insomnia247.nl>insomnia247.nl</a>:
<a href=https://git.insomnia247.nl/coolfire>coolFire</a>, I came to know that certificates I&rsquo;m using for my Apache VHost
should be enough to encrypt my communication (through port 443) and I need not
start an encrypted relay from weechat. coolFire was also gracious enough to
throw in some voodoo and give me a custom URL for running my weechat instance.</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s start a WeeChat relay:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>/set relay.network.password y0ur_StRonG-pa$sw0rd:of*choice
/relay add weechat 9001 # Note that this is NOT encrypted.
</code></pre><p>For connecting to Glowing Bear, I use port 443 - which allows me to encrypt my
connection. Note that this isn&rsquo;t entirely safe, because the fellow users on my
host can still monitor port 9001, which is unecrypted and only protected by a
password. But, I can manage this level of risk! :-)</p><h2 id=icing-over-cake>Icing over cake</h2><p>I run glowing bear on qutebrowser, through which I can access the whole interface
without ever having to leave the comfort of my keyboard. \o/</p><h2 id=further-todo>Further todo</h2><p>Glowing Bear&rsquo;s notification system is a little weird - it just stops notifying
me out of the blue. Remember my friend, <a href=https://blog.lazkani.io/about_me/>Armagaeddon</a>? He actually
has a weechat plugin for channeling remote notifications to local systems, but
it turned out that the script will take some additional work to work with macOS.</p><p>Another thing that I want to do is employ a chat logger - I&rsquo;ve had some pretty
interesting conversation with people, and they just wash away as soon as I
restart weechat. This should be pretty easy to do, but I&rsquo;ve had too much on my
plate to care right now.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Using mosh - &lsquo;mobile shell&rsquo;, which supports intermittent connectivity,
