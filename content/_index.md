# Hey there, I'm Rahul.

I currently work as software engineer at [Airbase](https://airbase.com).

I help maintain [Vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) – a tool to scavenge dead Python code, and contribute to other open source projects.

I write a newsletter, [etcetra]({{< relref "/blog" >}}), with articles on learning, technology, and design.

<!-- In case you’re wondering about what I’m upto currently, you can read my [now]({{< relref "/blog" >}}) page. -->
