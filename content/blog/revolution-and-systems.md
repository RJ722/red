Today, I read the [story of Silk Road][silkroad] about how a particular young
idealist Ross Ulbricht, tired of chasing success the old school way, found his
way around the darkweb[^1] to create an online bazaar for the trading of illicit
materials, mainly drugs, which he named Silk Road.

[^1]: It was operated as a *Tor* hidden service which protected the personal privacy of users by concealing their details from anyone - from the Government to their ISP - conducting network surveillance. Additionally, all payments were made using [Bitcoin][bitcoin], a cryptocurrency which provides a certain degree of anonymity.

The aim behind writing this blog post is to think out loud and try to gain
insight into the oversights made by some of the most prominent revolutionaries
in history.

When operating his online empire, Ross would take on the identity of Dread
Pirate Roberts (~DPR) (borrowing the name from *"The Princess Bride"*, in which
the pirate was a mythical character, inhabited by the wearer of the mask).

Ross (aka DPR) was having trouble switching back-and-forth between these
different personalities, the many different facets of which were penned down
beautifully [in the original article ][silkroad]:

{{< blockquote >}}
To Alex, Ross was the cool new roommate; to Julia [his on-and-off girlfriend],
a passionate lover and inspiration; to his family, the perpetual Eagle Scout;
to Force [undercover DEA Agent posing as a Puerto Rican cartel middlemen], an
unlikely friend in the night; to Tarbell [FBI Agent investigating his case], a
smart kid defeated by his own arrogance. To the Southern District of New York
US attorney’s office, Ross was simply the criminal conspirator Dread Pirate
Roberts.

The likeliest reality is that Ross was all of those things. The open-minded
seeker who conscientiously tried to pluck trash from a tree was Ross. As was
the feverish visionary creating a virtual empire at any cost. Neither truth
invalidated the other. Ross and DPR can (and did) coexist.

Ross didn't exactly dream of building this huge empire of illicit business, but
it was essentially all baby steps[^2], stemming from the influence Ludwig von Mises - an Austrian economist described
in the [story][silkroad] as "a totem of the modern American libertarian
orthodoxy" - had on Ross. According to von Mises, a citizen must have economic
freedom to be politically and morally free.

[^2]: As B.J. Neblett said "We are the sum total of our
experiences. Those experiences – be they positive or negative – make us the
person we are, at any given point in our lives. And, like a flowing river, those
same experiences, and those yet to come, continue to influence and reshape the
person we are, and the person we become. None of us are the same as we were
yesterday, nor will be tomorrow.".


If you haven't read the [story][silkroad] yet, please do and then come back! It
might easily be one of the most riveting cyber-criminology reports you ever
read.

Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Ludwig von Mises, they all had an ideology - a
vision of the ideal world, and a way of bringing peace to world. For them, it
embodied an expression which society must adhere to lead them towards utter
completeness and happiness.

The ideology of Hitler was an ideology of conquest: the "manifest destiny" of
a superior race to conquer, occupy, and control lands of the "lesser" people -
the _Untermenschen_ - for the sole benefit of the superior race.

The ideal society for Stalin was one in which people contribute to it because
they feel it is their pleasure and responsibility to do so, and in which people
only consume what they need while being mindful of the needs of others.

And they executed their ideas, bringing about their 'revolution'!

Both regimes - the Third Reich and Stalinism - were responsible for millions of
deaths and untold amounts of suffering.

Although one can argue that Ross Ulbricht's 'revolution' was nowhere near that
scale, but that is immaterial to our discussion. It followed the same pattern
which was summed up by Bearman rather well in the original story:

[darknet]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet

{{< blockquote cite="Bearman">}}
It’s an age-old story, the bloom and wilt of revolution. After tearing down
the establishment’s walls, the new regime soon realizes the rubble would make
a fine set of gallows. Just as Tarbell thought, all systems are the same. At
the beginning of Silk Road, what Ross created was just a system. Then, at a
certain point, it became his system—at which moment the system was doomed.

Isn't it strange – How we become the very thing we fight against?

For people who prefer examples in fiction over history, what happened with the
[finale of Game of Thrones][gotfinale] is a prime example of this pattern. Be
warned that there are spoilers ahead. In light of everything Daenerys [one of
show's main protagonists] accomplished — birthing dragons out of stone, freeing
thousands of slaves, helping the Starks defeat an army of ice-zombies — the
viewers first handedly experienced the mindset of a revolutionary who believed
that it was incumbent upon her to liberate the entire world. Yet it was when she
failed to draw a line between herself and her vision[^3] that she failed as a
ruler, becoming exactly what she had hoped to abolish: tyranny. It is worth
noting here that all the while she unapologetically burnt the innocent, she was
fueled by the exact same idea - to liberate the innocents of the world from
tyranny.

[^3]: The time when she succumbed to her temptations, burning alive and hence
killing thousands of people in King's Landing.

In Ross's case, the fact that he was feeling uneasy even as DPR (who was a
rather confident and eloquent character); that he had already begun failing at
what he had intended to do was the first clue that the shadows of doom had
already fallen upon him. But he deceived himself in the name of his idea - in
the belief that he was doing the "right thing".

Is it really this belief and total devotion to our idea that blinds us, or is it
the power and the riches which corrupts us? Or maybe it is a fundamental
misunderstanding of our very own conceived idea? Perhaps it might be a skewed
combination of all of the above.

I do not claim to know the answers to any of the above questions.

But let's look at another revolutionary: Mahatma Gandhi and the revolution
he brought about in India.

{{< figure src="images/revolution-and-systems/gandhi.jpg" title="Mahatma Gandhi was called Bapu (Father) by many, including Jawaharlal Nehru" >}}

In response to the [Rowlatt Act][rowlatt] imposed by the British and the
[Jallianwala Bagh Massacre][jallianwala], Gandhi lead the non-cooperation
movement, appealing to the masses to adopt swadeshi goods and local handicrafts
to boycott British goods. The movement was based on the principle of _Ahimsa_
(Non-Violence), and after two years of hard work, it gained full momentum
in 1922. It seemed that the dream of _Swaraj_ (self-governance) was finally
turning to reality.

But giving a face to Gandhi's fears, cases of violence were reported from all
over the nation, and after the [Chauri-Chaura][chaurichaura][^4] incident, he
decided to call off the protest indefinitely. This was indeed a very difficult
and brave decision on his part - he could have gotten what he wanted and ignored
the 'milder' cases of violence for the nation, but his moral caliber was defiant
of such behavior and he chose to voice it.

[^4]: A large group of protesters participating in the Non-cooperation movement
clashed with the police, who opened fire. In retaliation, the demonstrators
attacked and set fire to a police station, killing all of its occupants.


It was perhaps because he believed in a perpetual fight - a fight we
all have to fight against our own moral demons - in which the nation must not
succumb to the demon of violence.

Subsequently, Gandhi launched many campaigns perfecting the concept of
[_Satyagrah_][satyagrah][^5] finally leading the nation to independence in 1947.

[^5]: "सत्याग्रह (Satyagrah): सत्य (Truth) + आग्रह (insistence) - सत्य के लिए आग्रह – The truth force, is a particular form of non-violent civil resistance.

[rowlatt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowlatt_Act
[jallianwala]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre
[chaurichaura]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauri_Chaura_incident
[satyagrah]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha

I guess we all get to play Ross sometimes, and I believe that creating barriers,
as Gandhi did, to encourage the higher moral stance of one's own values - be it
by ruthless questioning of one's own beliefs and biases, or having an external
support mechanism for keeping oneself on track - would help us dodge the doom of
our system.

But I do find it very interesting to ponder upon how 'easy' it is to be lost, to
be engrossed so deeply into our visions to forget what it stood for in the first
place; to cross the rather fine line drawn between us and the monster, and how
tools like identities and the different masks we wear make it all the more
easier.
