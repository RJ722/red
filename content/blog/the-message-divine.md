<p style="text-align: center !important; font-style: italic;">
I had chills down my spine <br>
You see, I was just about to kiss her <br>
After I had had a sipe of my wine <br>
But the morning breeze woke me up <br>
Somebody left open the window blind <br>
I feel I've fallen in love <br>
As I feast now on the brilliance of ripe sunshine <br>
Embracing me with its comforting warmth <br>
Takes me back to the good ol' time <br>
Past the heartbreaks. Past the ugly banter <br>
It's a message from the divine <br>
To love, to hug and to kiss more often <br>
I've fallen so far behind <br>
